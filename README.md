# 🏥 MedAI: Multi-Disease Diagnostic System
MedAI is an AI-powered healthcare diagnostic platform designed to provide fast, accessible, and easy-to-understand medical scan analysis. It combines the power of Computer Vision for disease detection and Generative AI (LLMs) for clinical reporting.

## 📝 Problem Statement
Traditional medical diagnostic processes can be time-consuming, and patients often struggle to understand complex radiological reports. There is a need for a system that can:
Provide instant preliminary analysis of medical images.
Bridge the language barrier for non-English speaking patients (specifically Telugu).
Offer an easy-to-use interface for maintaining patient history.

## 🚀 Solution Approach
Image Classification: Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning to classify Brain Tumors, Pneumonia, Retina diseases, and Skin Cancer.Clinical Analysis: Integrated Groq (Llama 3.3) to generate detailed medical reports based on AI predictions.
Bilingual Support: Developed a system to provide reports in both English and Telugu.
Voice Integration: Used gTTS to convert the Telugu analysis into speech for better accessibility.
Data Management: Implemented SQLite for secure user authentication and historical record keeping.

## ✨ Project Features
Multi-Disease Detection: Brain Tumor, Pneumonia, Retina, and Skin Cancer analysis.
Detailed Clinical Reports: Professional insights using LLMs.
Bilingual Analysis: Native Telugu support for reports.
Audio Report: Listen to the diagnostic report in Telugu.
